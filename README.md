### Purpose

As a Bangladeshi-Canadian, this project holds deep personal significance for me. Growing up, I witnessed firsthand the challenges faced by our countryâ€” from the unpredictable monsoons that dictate our agricultural cycles to outbreaks of diseases like dengue fever, cholera, and malaria that affect communities across the country.
Driven by a desire to make a tangible difference, I embarked on this journey to harness the power of technology for social good. Through the medium of choropleth maps, this project aims to illuminate two critical facets of Bangladesh:

1. **Annual Rainfall Average per District**: This visualization not only showcases the varying rainfall patterns across our diverse landscapes but also underscores its pivotal role in shaping our nation's agricultural prosperity.

2. **Average Dengue Cases per Capita by District**: By mapping the prevalence of dengue cases across Bangladesh's districts, this project aims to raise awareness about a pressing public health issue that impacts the lives of countless Bangladeshis every year.

Through these visualizations, I hope to foster a deeper understanding and empathy for the socio-economic and environmental challenges that unfortunately, still cripple my nation.

### Technologies Used

- **Programming Languages**: Python - libraries such as: Pandas, GeoPandas, Folium.
- **Data Sources**: Statistical data on rainfall sourced from the Bangladesh Water Development Board. Statistical data on dengue fever sourced from the United Nations
